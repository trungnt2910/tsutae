# tsutae

tsutae is a self-bot based on [`discord.py-self`](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self)
allowing users to forward messages from a channel to another one. This is useful, for example,
for ban evasion, where you want to keep track of updates from servers you are banned from without
having to constantly switch to your alt account.

tsutae is a one-way bridge.

Python 3.11 or higher is required.
